About
This is an interactive Power BI dashboard of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It shows total, as well as per capita and per GDP data, by location (country/continent), year and source of emission.

All data was taken from "Our World in Data": https://github.com/owid/co2-data

Raw data was cleaned by removing columns with data that can be calculated using DAX, such as cumulative or per capita data. Then it was normalised and split into 5 tables (as in the diagram below).
